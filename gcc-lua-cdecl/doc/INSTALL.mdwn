title: Installing
---

Before installing the module, make sure to [install the Lua plugin for GCC].

[install the Lua plugin for GCC]: http://colberg.org/gcc-lua/INSTALL.html

cdecl for GCC is available from a [git repository]:

~~~
git clone http://git.colberg.org/gcc-lua-cdecl
~~~

In the repository, checkout the latest release version:

~~~
git checkout 2.0.1
~~~

If you have GnuPG, verify that the tag is signed by the following key:

~~~
git tag -v 2.0.1
~~~

~~~
Primary key fingerprint: 2997 6EC2 2BD1 EBBC CC77  F3A6 183B D5ED 3527 8611
     Subkey fingerprint: 983B F9D0 F02A 6014 0CEC  529F 767E 12A8 C92A 31CB
~~~

The module is accompanied by a test suite:

~~~
make test
~~~

By default, the tests assume that the Lua plugin for GCC is located in the
parent directory of the repository.

If the plugin is installed in the [GCC plugin directory], override the make
variable `GCCLUA`.

~~~
make test GCCLUA=gcclua
~~~

If the plugin is located in a different directory:

~~~
make test GCCLUA=${HOME}/projects/gcc-lua/gcc/gcclua.so
~~~

You may also specify the plugin directory in the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:

~~~
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${HOME}/projects/gcc-lua/gcc${LD_LIBRARY_PATH+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
~~~

The plugin may then be loaded by passing its filename:

~~~
make test GCCLUA=gcclua.so
~~~

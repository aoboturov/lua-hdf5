[HDF5 for Lua] provides bindings for the Hierarchical Data Format ([HDF5]),
a file format and library for portable, flexible and efficient storage of
numerical data. [LuaJIT] is a just-in-time compiler for the [Lua] language
that provides native C data structures through its foreign function interface
([FFI]) library. HDF5 for Lua supports HDF5 1.8 using LuaJIT.

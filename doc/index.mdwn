% About HDF5 for Lua

[HDF5 for Lua] provides bindings for the Hierarchical Data Format ([HDF5]),
a file format and library for portable, flexible and efficient storage of
numerical data. [Lua] is a powerful, fast, lightweight, and embeddable
scripting language. [LuaJIT] is a just-in-time compiler for the Lua language,
which allows using native C data structures as part of its foreign function
interface library ([FFI]). HDF5 for Lua supports [HDF5 1.8] or later, using
LuaJIT.

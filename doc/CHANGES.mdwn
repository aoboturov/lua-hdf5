[semantic versioning]: http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html


gcc‑lua‑cdecl 1.2.0 (2013-12-12) {#v1.2.0}
--------------------------------

  * Fix test suite with GCC 4.6.

  * Fix parsing of variable-length struct types.

  * FFI C: output types in the order of their definition.

    Capture macros may appear in arbitrary order, which facilitates generation
    of capture files using ctags.

  * Support GCC 4.5.

I would like to thank Dennis Schridde for contributing to this release
by reporting bugs, suggesting features, and testing revisions.


gcc‑lua‑cdecl 1.1.0 (2013-10-06) {#v1.1.0}
--------------------------------

  * The `cdecl_const` macro of `ffi-cdecl.lua` supports comma operators.

    This allows parsing C preprocessor constants with side effects:

    ~~~ {.c}
    #define H5F_ACC_EXCL (H5check_version(1, 8, 11), 0x0004u)
    ~~~

    The resulting FFI C constant is defined with value `4`.


gcc‑lua‑cdecl 1.0.0 (2013-09-29) {#v1.0.0}
--------------------------------

  * Initial release of the C declaration composer for the GCC Lua plugin.
